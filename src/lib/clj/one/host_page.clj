  "Given a configuration map and an environment, return HTML (as a

  must be either `:development` or `:production` - any other value results
  in an exception. The generated HTML is based on the contents of
  application.html, which is loaded as an Enlive resource.

  In production mode, the HTML (as a sequence of Enlive nodes) is
  transformed via the `:prod-transform` function from the config map.

  This function is normally called in two situations:

  1. From a Ring application to dynamically generate the application
     HTML.

  2. From the build script to create static deployment artifacts."
